"""Provision two Customer checkboxes that gate the External Refinery Flow.

- ``custom_block_refining`` — when set, ALL of this customer's batches are kept
  out of Dust Refining and Scrap Refining (filtered from the fetch and hard-blocked
  at submit by ``RefiningEntry``).
- ``custom_no_wastage`` — when set, customer-supplied material must not be charged
  manufacturing wastage: process loss on this customer's batches is blocked so the
  unused weight returns as raw material instead of a customer-owned scrap batch
  (enforced in Employee IR ``book_metal_loss`` / loss stock entry).

These are two distinct policies on two different lifecycles (refining vs
manufacturing), so they are separate flags.

Because ``after_migrate`` is disabled and ``install-app`` marks patches complete
WITHOUT running them on fresh / CI sites, a fixture-only column would never reach
the DB. Per the app convention this is wired in two idempotent places: this
``post_model_sync`` patch and ``create_test_data.setup_data``. Can also be run
ad-hoc::

    bench --site <site> execute jewellery_erpnext.patches.add_customer_refining_flags.execute

Idempotent: ``create_custom_fields`` keys on ``(dt, fieldname)``.
